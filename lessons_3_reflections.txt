When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Working on a joint project, it seems important to maintain a central repository for everyone to work from.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

You want to make sure that the version doesn't change out from underneath you.
